# Various projects related to React, ReactJS and React Native

Here are some projects related to ReactJS, some of them are from the Udemy's 2023 versions.

* `hello-world`: This is just a simple project that was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is using a pre-configured webpack build for development.
* `react-complete-guide` This project is part of sections 3 to 7 and is being used to understand the base features and syntax of React.
* `burger-builder-basic` This project is part of section 8 and it is the first 'real app' on its basic version to demostrate how to use all the features and syntax of React reviewed so far in this course.
* `burger-builder-server` This project is part of section 10 and it is the imporoved version of the basic burger application to demostrate how to implement and integrate the backend using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) to store and retrieve our orders even after our single-page is reloaded.
* `burger-builder-server-routing` This project is part of section 12 and it is the imporoved version of the server burger application to demostrate how to implement and integrate the routing features of ReactJS.
* `http-ajax-examples` This project is part of section 9 and it is an aplication on its basic version to demostrate how to use Axios and some of its features so you can reach out to the Web.

# JS Array Functions

Not really next-gen JavaScript, but also important: JavaScript array functions like map() , filter() , reduce()  etc. You'll see me use them quite a bit since a lot of React concepts rely on working with arrays (in immutable ways).

The following page gives a good overview over the various methods you can use on the array prototype - feel free to click through them and refresh your knowledge as required: [JS Reference: Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array). Particularly important in this course are:
- map()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
- find()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find
- findIndex()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex
- filter()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
- reduce()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce?v=b
- concat()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat?v=b
- slice()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice
- splice()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice
