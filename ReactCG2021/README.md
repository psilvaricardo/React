# Various projects related to React, ReactJS and React Native

Here are some projects related to ReactJS, some of them are from the Udemy's 2021 versions.

* `hello-world`: This is just a simple project that was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is using a pre-configured webpack build for development.
* `react-complete-guide` This project is part of sections 3, 4 and is being used to understand the base features and syntax of React.

# JS Array Functions

Not really next-gen JavaScript, but also important: JavaScript array functions like map() , filter() , reduce()  etc. You'll see me use them quite a bit since a lot of React concepts rely on working with arrays (in immutable ways).

The following page gives a good overview over the various methods you can use on the array prototype - feel free to click through them and refresh your knowledge as required: [JS Reference: Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array). Particularly important in this course are:
- map()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
- find()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find
- findIndex()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex
- filter()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
- reduce()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce?v=b
- concat()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat?v=b
- slice()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice
- splice()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice
