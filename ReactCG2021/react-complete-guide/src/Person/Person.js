// Capital letter on the file name is just a React convention.

// There are a few ways to create a new Component. A new 
// component could be just a simple JS funcion, in its siplest 
// form, it's just a function that returns some JSX. You could 
// also use the ES6 syntax of creating a variable which holds a 
// function, which in the end would result in the same.
// As a best practice, we will use ES6:

const person = (props) => {

    return (
        // we can use this new StyleDiv as a regular react component:
        <div className={classes.Person}>
            <p onClick={props.click}>I'm {props.name} and I'm {props.age} years old</p>
            <p>{props.children}</p>
            <input type="text" onChange={props.changed} value={props.name} />
        </div>
    )
}

export default person;
