# Assignment 1 - Time to practice the base syntax

Instructions:

- Create TWO new components: UserInput and UserOutput
- UserInput should hold an input element, UserOutput two paragraphs
- Output multiple UserOutput components in the App component (any paragraph texts of your choice)
- Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it there
- Add state to the App component (=> the username) and pass the username to the UserOutput component
- Add a method to manipulate the state (=> an event-handler method)
- Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input-change event
- Ensure that the new input entered by the user overwrites the old username passed to UserOutput
- Add two-way-binding to your input (in UserInput) to also display the starting username
- Add styling of your choice to your components/ elements in the components - both with inline styles and stylesheets
